DNS.Surf runs 100% on Vercel, so Vercel Analytics is used for access statistics.

elements using rules. Vercel Analytics is blocked by the rule
/\_vercel/insights/script.js, and it may also block /\_vercel/insights/event. To
solve this problem, we just need to make these two URLs less recognizable.
