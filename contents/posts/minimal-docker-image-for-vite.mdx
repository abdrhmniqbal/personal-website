Recently, Iâ€™ve been preparing to migrate projects hosted on Cloudflare, Vercel,
and Netlify to my own VPS to run via Docker. I revisited Docker image packaging.
However, even a small project ended up being packaged into a 1.05GB image, which
is clearly unacceptable. So, I researched minimal Docker image packaging for
Node.js projects, reducing the image size from 1.06GB to 135MB.
